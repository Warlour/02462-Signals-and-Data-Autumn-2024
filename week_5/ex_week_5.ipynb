    "# Week 5 - Fourier transforms\n",
    "\n",
    "*The perhaps two most important takeaways from this lecture should be:*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *The fourier theorem states that **any** function can be represented as an infinite sum of complex exponentials:*\n",
    "$$x(n) = \\sum_{n = - \\infty }^{+\\infty}x(n) e^{-i \\omega n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Euler's identity states that:*\\\n",
    "\n",
    "   a.  A complex exponential can be written as the sum of a cosine and a complex sine\n",
    "$$e^{i \\theta} = \\cos(\\theta) + i \\sin(\\theta)$$\n",
    "   b.  *Likewise, a cosine \\or a sine function can be written as the following sums of complex exponentials*\n",
    "$$\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{e^{i \\theta} + e^{-i \\theta}}{2}, \\quad \\sin(\\theta) = \\frac{i(e^{-i \\theta} - e^{i \\theta})}{2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*Knowing these two things will get you through 99% of signal processing on a good day. Most of what this is used for in practical terms is the **fourier transform***\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X(k) = \\sum_{n = 0}^{N-1} x(n) e^{-i 2\\pi \\frac{kn}{N}} \\quad \\text{DFT (discrete case)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X(k) = \\int^N_{0} x(t) e^{-i 2\\pi t} dt \\quad \\text{Continuous case (not used in this course)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The (discrete) fourier transform can intuitively be understood in the following way:\n",
    "1. We input some discrete function f(n) into the fourier transform\n",
    "2. $\\star$ The values $X(k)$ we get out are amplitudes associated with sinusoidals of specific frequencies, needed to reconstruct the signal\n",
    "   1. (Rough example): getting $X(1) = 3$ means that the amplitude associated with the freqeuncy $f_k = \\frac{k}{N}f_s$ is $3$ where $N$ is the number of samples and $f_s$ is the sampling rate.  \n",
    "3. $\\star$ Important to note: due to the symmetry of the fourier transform and the nyquist rate, if you have $N$ samples of a digital signal with a sampling rate of $f_s$, you will get $\\frac{N}{2}$ different frequencies from the fourier transform, with half being positive frequencies and half being negative frequencies. Typically the postive ones are just removed from plots and such. Also the maximum frequency you will get from the fourier transform is $\\frac{f_s}{2}$, so you are in a way automatically insured against aliasing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### $\\star$ Wait... about that second point?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yeah... when you calcuate the fourier coefficients $X(k)$, **they do not directly correspond to the frequencies**. Each X(k) will be a **frequency bin**. The amount of frequency bins will be from $k = 0 \\dots N-1$ so $N$ in total. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these frequency bins (which is what you get when you put in a specific value of $k$ value in $X(k)$), corresponds to a frequency equal to $\\frac{k}{N}f_s$ this will increase up to $k = \\frac{N}{2}$ (if N is even or $\\frac{N-1}{2}$ if N is odd), after this, the frequencies will **loop** and become negative, representing the complex part of the spectrum. \n",
    "\n",
    "Essentailly, this means that the larger you make your sampling rate (in Hertz), the the longer there will be between the frequency bins in the frequency domain. You can alleviate this by simply taking more samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### $\\star$ And what about the negative frequencies?\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned, we usually just remove those. Keep in mind when doing this, you need to mulitply the amplitudes of to positive frequencies by 2. As half the energy (amplitude) of each frequency is in the complex spectrum..."

    "## $\\star$ Exercise 5 - The Short-Time Fourier transform\n",
    "\n",
    "*This is just to show what can also be done. There is something called the short time fourier transform (STFT). What this does is split a time signal into a bunch of smaller time intervals, and computes the fourier transform for each smaller interval. Laying all of these FT's in series produces what is known as a spectogram, which you may have already know from Intro to Intelligent systems*\n",

    "The answer can vary, but the main reason is in use for signals where the frequency content can change quickly. Take for example human speech where the frequency content can change widely depending on what is being said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example (that I am currently working on), is when you have a signal that has been filtered with an unknown signal and need to unfilter it. The STFT lets you amplify or attentuate frequencies on specific timesteps, rather than frequencies over the entire time domain. This lets you have much greater dergree of granularity when doing inverse problems such as that.\n",

    "\n",
    "**2. How do you implement this?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Shown below. You need a few more parameters that the regular FT, most of which determine how the different time segments overlap. The 'window' parameter is a kind of filter that determines how one or more time segments overlap, while the nperseg is how many time units is used for each segment. A larger number creates a more 'mean value' for each segment and has smoother transitions, as well as being faster, while a smaller value gives greater granularity in what the frequency content is at a specific timestep, but can vary more and is slower."
