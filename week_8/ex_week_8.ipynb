    "As you have seen in the lectures, NLP has a wide range of techniques and applications of such techniques. We will give you an introduction to some of these techniques, and today you will get hands-on experience with them. In today's exercise, we will look at the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How do we represent text in a vectorized way that encodes context? (One answer here is N-grams, and those we will look at).\n",
    "2. How do we create and sample from an N-gram language model - and how does the size of the grams affect the generated text?\n",
    "3. How do we use a pre-existing language model (FastText), to classify text messages as spam?\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we will be using later today is a dataset consisting of \"spam or ham\" text messages. The dataset consists of a number of text messages, some of which are spam and some of which are so-called \"ham\". We will use FastText to classify mails as spam or ham. For now, we will be looking at some different texts, to see how we can use N-grams to generate text, and how we can create N-gram language models from a text corpus."

In essence, we can give a seed to our conditional probability (also called a context), and then we need to generate a word from our conditional probability by sampling from it.\n",

    "    - If the text seed is too long change it to the last N-1 words\n",
