    "# N-grams, Fastttext, and GloVE\n",
    "\n",
    "*This assignment focuses on exploring Fasttext and GloVE as NLP methods. We are going to focus on two tasks and ways of understanding models:*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *The traditional, \"model is a classifier\" viewpoint. Here we are going to work with the [AG News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amananandrai/ag-news-classification-dataset) to classify genres*\n",
    "2. *The more vector-based way, seeing them basically as machines that just generate word vectors, with everything else just being gravy. Barring attaching a specific classifier, GloVE falls entirely under this category.* \n",
    "\n",
    "*In this assignment, we are mainly going to be using the [AG News Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amananandrai/ag-news-classification-dataset), a corpus of more than 1 million news articles, each classified as one of four classes: 'Business', 'Sci/Tech', 'World', or 'Sports'. Note, that because of the semi-supervised nature of most methods used in this assignment, we could almost do the whole thing without the labels. They're just there to make it a bit simpler and to provide an obvious usecase.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**For the GloVe part, note that you can download all their pretrained vectors at the [GloVe project page](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/).**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0. Extra primer on Fasttext\n",
    "\n",
    "*As you know, n-grams are pretty useful for improving the otherwise limited bag-of-words (BoW) model. Most often, this is by making distinctions between sentences such as \"good\" and \"not good\" which would be represented somewhat the same in a regular BoW. It is very obvious if we consider the sentence \"Maria stole the milk\" vs \"The milk stole Maria\", two sentences completely identical in the BoW representation, but with two obviously different meanings.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*As you also know, Fasttext takes this further by creating chracter-wise n-grams. These are made up of n-characters of a single word. This allows fasttext to consider cases such as grammar, where words are spelled similarly and even consider misspellings, if someone makes a mistaek in wirtign a wrod, the character-wise n-gram representation will be **almost** the same as the correct word.*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is done by Fasttext simply storing embedding vectors $v_n$ for each n-gram, character or otherwise. Fasttext will simply then average all of these vectors, word, character-wise n-grams, and word-wise n-grams to create the representation for a given text or sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$v_{total} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum^N_{n=0} v_n$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important note: Fasttext supervised and unsupervised\n",
    "\n",
    "*If you look into the technical documentation for the fasttext model, you'll notice that there are options to train both an **unsupervised** and a **supervised** version of the fasttext model. These use similar approaches, but it is arguably the unsupervised model that best describes what the fasttext team wanted to accomplish: efficient word-vector generation for downstream usage.*\n",
    "\n",
    "***The supervised model:***\n",
    "- *Needs a corpus of text with given labels to train*\n",
    "- *Does not use skipgram/CBoW, but just works as a 'normal' FFN for classification*\n",
    "- *Uses character-wise n-grams*\n",
    "- *Uses word-wise n-grams the same way as the unsupervised model uses character-wise n-grams, treating them as vectors and combining them in the end for the final classification.*\n",
    "- *Can be directly evaluated by just checking how good it is at predicting the given classes.*\n",
    "\n",
    "***The unsupervised model:*** (not important for this assignment or course, just cool to know)\n",
    "- *Just needs a corpus of text to train*\n",
    "- *Does not use wordwise n-grams*\n",
    "- *Has vectors for each unique character n-gram and each unique word in the corpus (limited by bin size)* \n",
    "- *Vectors for character n-grams are created indepedently of word vectors, for example the trigram \"her\" present in \"where\" has a different vector representation than the one for the full word \"her\".*\n",
    "- *Is a purely skipgram/CBoW model (input layer, one hidden, output layer)*\n",
    "- *Cannot be directly evaluated except in qualitative ways by considering the downstream tasks it will be used in*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***Both models***\n",
    "- *Only work on CPU (bvadr) (what a time 2015 was!)*"

    "*GloVe is called a \"global log-bilinear regression model\" which combines the strengths of global matrix factorization and local context window methods.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*In English, this means it combines methods that work by collecting information on the entire corpus, with other methods that capture more local patterns, essentially what we see with Fasttext that considers local n-grams. GloVe just considers \"context windows\" rather than an n-gram. Overall, what they want are nicely defined, linear relationships, decided by comparing the co-occurences of different words.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*The selling point really, is that while a run-of-the-mill neural network **may** be able to answer the questions: \"Skibidi is to Toilet as Fanum is to ...?\", it will not necessarily be able to do it in a linear manner. Therefore considering all the word vectors together in their latent space, may not yield good information. GloVe fixes this by keeping all vector substructures linear.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Essentially, GloVe trains by mixing a [Skipgram model](http://mccormickml.com/2016/04/19/word2vec-tutorial-the-skip-gram-model/) (just a neural network) with a function that works more on the entire corpus, while maintaining a weighting between the two. Because GloVe works best on huge corpora of data, we are not going to train it ourselves, but just use pretrained GloVe vectors, collected from their [project page](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/).* \n",
